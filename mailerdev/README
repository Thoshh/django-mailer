TO SEE DEMO IN ACTION
(you might want to comment out the call to core_send_mail in engine.py first)

1.  `python manage.py syncdb` and create superuser for admin
    
2.  `python manage.py loaddata test1` to load some test data from a fixture
    
3.  `python manage.py runserver` to fire up the development server
    
4.  go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and check out the mailer models
    
5.  open a separate shell and run `python manage.py shell`
    
6.  at the interactive prompt, type `from mailer.engine import send_loop`
    
7.  start the send loop with `send_loop()`
    
    You will see four mail sends are simulated and one is skipped because
    the addressee is on the don't send list.
    
    The loop will then sleep for (by default) 30 seconds before checking
    the queue again. It will continue this indefinitely.
    
8.  with the send loop still running, go back to the django admin console
    
9.  notice that the message model is now empty and the messages have moved
    to the message log model
    
10. add a new message (the addresses don't matter if you commented out the
    call to core_send_mail in engine.py)
    
    Watch the interactive console and, within the sleep period, you should
    see the message you added picked up and a send simulated.

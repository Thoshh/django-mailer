A reusable Django app for queuing and throttling of email sending, scheduled
sending, consolidation of multiple notifications into single emails and 
logging of mail failures.

Sample Use Cases

* a site admin wants to send a one-off announcement to all users on a site
* a site admin wants to send a one-off email to a subset of users (e.g. thank
  you note to users who completed a survey)
* a site admin wants to send an email but wants to defer it to a particular
  date or time (e.g. send out at 9am tomorrow a reminder of the scheduled
  downtime at 10am)
* a site admin wants to send a regular email to a subset of users (e.g.
  people who haven't logged in for over a month)
* a user wants email notification when certain events specific to them happen
  (e.g. a friend accepts their invitation to join a group, they receive a
  private message)
* a user wants email notification when certain events relevant to a subset of
  users happen (e.g. there has been a reply to a message board thread or blog
  entry that the user has subscribed to)
* a user doesn't want individual emails for each notification but wants them
  in digest form (e.g. a daily digest of new posts or a weekly update on
  friends who have joined)
